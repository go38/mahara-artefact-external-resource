DEV NOTE

Note that the artefact is used as a cache mecanism to avoid fetching the 
resource's metadata each time a view is displayed.

Blocks will create a new artefact each time the configuration is saved. Old artefacts
are deleted when the block is deleted or when a new artefact is created.

There are currently no interface to display the list of external resource artefacts.
